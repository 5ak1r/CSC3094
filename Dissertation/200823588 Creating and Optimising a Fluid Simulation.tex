    \section{Abstract}
    This dissertation explores the Navier-Stokes equations, which are used to describe the motion of fluids. It briefly looks at an Eulerian implementation introduced by Jos Stam \cite{stam}, before shifting focus on to Lagrangian methods - specifically Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Furthermore,this paper describes an implementation of this technique. \\ The main goal of this project is to produce a real-time fluid simulation that can be integrated into a video game, with minimal performance loss. It is an optimisation problem, motivated by an interest in the GPU and shader languages.
